Ok, basically I thought the .env file was stupid if you
could easily just write in the token and path.
I'm also adding new functionalities that will
take in parameters like a description or having
the choice for it to be private and whatnot.
Also trying to make things more simple, and 
adding the option to have repo names with spaces in it
/ user comfortability. Also, I'm new to pull requests,
if you couldn't already tell by this crappy txt.
Ok thx, bye

So since I'm getting close to finishing, just pointing
out that I'll be deleting this file. Something like this
will be found in the description of the pull request, whenever
I make it, probably some time tonight
